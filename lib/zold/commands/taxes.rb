module Zold
  # Taxes command.
  #
  # The user pays taxes for his/her wallet by running 'zold taxes pay'. As
  # the White Paper explains (find it at http://papers.zold.io), each wallet
  # has to pay certain amount of taxes in order to be accepted by any node
  # in the network. Of course, a node may make a decision to accept and
  # store any wallet, even if taxes are not paid, but the majority of
  # nodes will obey the rules and will reject wallets that haven't paid
  # enough taxes.
  #
  # Taxes are paid from wallet to wallet, not from clients to nodes. A wallet
  # just selects the most suitable wallet to transfer taxes to and sends
  # the payment. More details you can find in the White Paper.
